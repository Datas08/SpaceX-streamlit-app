## SpaceX-streamlit-app
### This app is an extension to the guided project provided by IBM on Coursera, by the name of IBM SpaceX capstone. As I wanted to try out the functionality of the streamlit cloud, I used the results of predicitive analytics done in the capstone as well as the extracted datasets. The model which performed the best was Support Vector Machine, and so, in the app svm was used for predicting landing outcome of Falcon9 based on the user-input
